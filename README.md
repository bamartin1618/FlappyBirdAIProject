# FlappyBirdAIProject
The code repository for the Flappy Bird AI project, containing both versions of the game: the control and experimental groups.

If you want to run the programs on your machine, you will need to download the images and NEAT configuration file found <a href = "https://github.com/bamartin1618/FlappyAI">here</a>. Also, you will need to change the file paths in the code.
